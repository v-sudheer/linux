node for DMA controller:
                       ast_uart_sdma: uart_sdma@1e79e000 {
                               compatible = "aspeed,ast-uart-sdma";

                       };
this node  doesn't binds with any driver.
DMA controller is handled as a separate SW layer,and is included in the same driver.
This DMA controller node is included in DT just for Register and interrupt details



node for DMA-UARTS :


Required properties:

- compatible: "aspeed,ast-sdma-uart"
- reg: The base address of the UART register bank
- interrupts: should contain interrupt specifier.
- clocks: Clock driving the hardware;
- pinctrl-0 : list of pinconfigurations
- dma-channel: channel of DMA-controller which is used

Example:

                 dma_uart1: dma_uart1@1e783000{
                          compatible = "aspeed,ast-sdma-uart";
                          reg = <0x1e783000 0x1000>;
                          reg-shift = <2>;
                          interrupts = <9>;
                          clocks = <&syscon ASPEED_CLK_GATE_UART1CLK>;
                          dma-channel = <0>;
                          no-loopback-test;
                          pinctrl-names = "default";
                          pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_txd1_default &pinctrl_rxd1_default>;
                          status = "disabled";
                       };
